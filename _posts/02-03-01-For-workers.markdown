Con: workaholism

> So, there is no commute, no office gossip, no coffee or lunch breaks with your teammates, and next to no human interaction. 
This could be a disastrous combination if you are prone to burnout. You’ll end up pushing yourself harder than you should, and 
since there’s nobody around to notice that you could use a break, chances are you won’t figure it out until it’s too late.

> I propose that most remote workers work at least as hard, if not more so, than their local counterparts. 
This is fueled in no small part by guilt and fear. We DO feel guilty working at home. 
We assume you all think we're just hanging out without pants on. 
We assume you think we're just at the mall tweeting. We fear that you think we aren't putting in a solid 40 hours (or 50, or 60).
