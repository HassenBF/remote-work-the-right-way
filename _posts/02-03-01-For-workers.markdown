Con: workaholism

> So, there is no commute, no office gossip, no coffee or lunch breaks with your teammates, and next to no human interaction. 
This could be a disastrous combination if you are prone to burnout. You’ll end up pushing yourself harder than you should, and 
since there’s nobody around to notice that you could use a break, chances are you won’t figure it out until it’s too late.
