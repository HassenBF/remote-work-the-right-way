###The Remote or Home Office Setup

> 
* __Headset__: A headset is crucial for avoiding echo during online calls; little things like this go a long way when working as a remote.
* __Quiet place to think__: 
* __Stable Internet connection__: having Skype issues or dropping calls, you’re becoming both less reliable and less professional
* __Skype__: This is good for adhoc conference calls, instant messaging with clients, or even creating low ceremony chat rooms.
* __Gallon jug of water__: For the kettle, or for drinking. For long coding sessions, or long conference calls.

###Making Your Presence Felt: Don’t Go Invisible

> When people know you’re currently hard at-work at home, you don’t become invisible. Build a relationship and let people know that you are there.

> Chat with people on chat and make sure you stay involved with your colleagues. This is different then when you bump into 
people in the coffee room, etc., etc. You need to explicitly reach out and stay in touch so that when you commit code or need assistance, people are ready.
