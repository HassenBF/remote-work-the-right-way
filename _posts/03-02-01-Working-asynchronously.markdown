> "An **asynchronos** working style is one where the entire team rarely, if ever, gets together for big agreements and 
discussions, each individual team member more or less works on their own and at their own pace, with collaboration and 
agreement being handled by asynchronous mechanisms such as e-mail and shared online documents. 
__Working asynchronously certainly enables the team to be geographically distributed, or telecommute, or maintain flexible hours.__"

> This is — by far — my favorite aspect of working at GitHub. Everything is asynchronous.
..Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous 
communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she'll get back to me when 
she's available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel like I'm working from the office like normal.

> Hours are great ways to determine productivity in many industries, but not ours. Working in a startup is a much different 
experience than working in a factory. 
You can't throw more time at a problem and expect it to get solved. Code is a creative endeavor. 
You need to be in the right mindset to create high-quality code.

> Do you really need a meeting? Meetings usually arise when a concept isn't clear enough. Instead of resorting to a meeting, 
try to simplify the concept so you can discuss it quickly via email or im or Campfire. The goal is to avoid meetings. 
Every minute you avoid spending in a meeting is a minute you can get real work done instead.
