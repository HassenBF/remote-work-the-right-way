> "An **asynchronos** working style is one where the entire team rarely, if ever, gets together for big agreements and discussions, each individual team member more or less works on their own and at their own pace, with collaboration and agreement being handled by asynchronous mechanisms such as e-mail and shared online documents. 
__Working asynchronously certainly enables the team to be geographically distributed, or telecommute, or maintain flexible hours.__"
