### Translations
If you are interested in translating _Remote Work: The Right Way_, fork this repo on GitHub and publish your
localized fork to your own GitHub Pages account. We'll link to your translation from the primary document.

To avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:

1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.io/remote-work-the-right-way`
2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. "it.remoteworktherightway.com")

If you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use
a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.

When your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.
